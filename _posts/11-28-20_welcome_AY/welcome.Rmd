This blog was created as part of the final project for the EDLD 654 [Applied Machine Learning for Educational Data Science](https://uo-datasci-specialization.github.io/c4-ml-fall-2020/), taught by [Prof. Daniel Anderson](https://github.com/datalorax) and [Prof. Joseph Nese](https://education.uoregon.edu/people/faculty/jnese) at the University of Oregon. The blog contains application of Machine Learning models to educational data for predictive analysis. Following models were presented in the final project:

1. Linear regression (add link to my post, if posting separate.)

2. Random Forest (add link Ale's post if posting separate)

3. Gradient Boosting (add link Chris's post, if posting separete)
