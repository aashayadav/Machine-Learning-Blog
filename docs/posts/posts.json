I decided to go with the Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples to conduct model fitting and model assessment due to its relatively lower run time, as compared to using cross-validation resamples.\r\nInitially, I planned to work locally on my computer with only 5% of the data. Overall, my model tuning process was taking between 15 and 25 minutes each round of tuning, but unfortunately my R session froze several times and I could not finish the model tuning process.\r\nAt this point, Daniel suggested I use HPC via the Open On Demand interface. As always, I was afraid to try something new, but Daniel patiently showed me how to work with the new interface and explained for the 97th time what was the difference between the train and test files we have been working with all term long. I think I finally got it! I’m glad it only took me ten weeks 😬 to understand this.\r\nPrep work\r\nI followed the same steps we have been following all term long, reading in the data, sampling a fraction of the data (note that I used 50% of the data because I was working with HPC), and joining with other datasets. Here I joined a dataset we called “bonus” that inlcudes variables from different datasets. To learn more about this dataset and its variables, please go here.\r\nA huge shout-out to Chris Ives for taking the time to find and process the bonus datasets we are using here.\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\n\r\nfull_train <- import(here(\"data\", \"train.csv\"), setclass = \"tbl_df\") %>%\r\n  select(-classification) %>%\r\n  mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>%\r\n  mutate(ncessch = as.double(ncessch)) %>%\r\n  sample_frac(0.5)\r\n\r\nbonus <- import(here(\"data\", \"bonus_data.csv\")) %>%\r\n  mutate(pupil_tch_ratio = as.numeric(pupil_tch_ratio)) %>%\r\n  mutate(ncessch = as.double(ncessch))\r\n\r\n## joining data\r\ndata <- left_join(full_train, bonus)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I created the initial split and the train and test objects for model fitting and assessment. Notice that I did not create a cross-validation resample object because I was only using the OOB samples.\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\ndata_split <- initial_split(data)\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\ndata_train <- training(data_split)\r\ndata_test <- testing(data_split)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI created a recipe following the recommended preprocessing steps for a Random Forest model. I found this guide that Joe shared with our group very useful.\r\nThis recipe is pretty straightforward, the only thing that I think is worth highlighting is that we took the liberty to assume that most of the students’ home language was English; that is why we specified this code lang_cd = case_when(lang_cd == \"S\" ~ \"S\", TRUE ~ \"E\"). I took extra care not to lose the Spanish speaking students in the lang_cd variable to the step_nzv() near-zero variance variable removal due to the role of language in academic achievement.\r\nIn this model, we had one outcome score, 77 predictors and ten Id variables.\r\n\r\n\r\nrec <- recipe(score ~ ., data_train) %>%\r\n  step_mutate(tst_dt = lubridate::mdy_hms(tst_dt),\r\n              lang_cd = case_when(lang_cd == \"S\" ~ \"S\", TRUE ~ \"E\"),\r\n              pupil_tch_ratio = as.numeric(pupil_tch_ratio)) %>% \r\n  update_role(contains(\"id\"), ncessch, ncesag, sch_name, new_role = \"id_vars\") %>%\r\n  step_zv(all_predictors(), -starts_with(\"lang_cd\")) %>%\r\n  step_medianimpute(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes(), -has_role(\"id_vars\")) %>%\r\n  step_novel(all_nominal()) %>%\r\n  step_unknown(all_nominal()) %>% \r\n  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>%\r\n  step_nzv(all_predictors(), -starts_with(\"lang_cd\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s dive in on the model fitting process!\r\nFirst, I wanted to develop a baseline model using the default hypermarameters. I focused only on three hyperparameters: predictors mtry = floor(p/3), number of trees trees = 500, and minimun node size min_n = 5. In this model, mtry was around 26 predictors.\r\n\r\n\r\n# default model\r\nrf_def <- rand_forest() %>%\r\n  set_engine(\"ranger\",\r\n             num.threads = 8,\r\n             importance = \"permutation\",\r\n             verbose = TRUE) %>%\r\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\r\n\r\n# workflow for default model\r\nrf_def_wkflw <- workflow() %>% \r\n  add_model(rf_def) %>% \r\n  add_recipe(rec)\r\n\r\n# fitting the default model\r\nrf_def_fit <- fit(\r\n  rf_def_wkflw,\r\n  data_train)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rmse for the default model was 88.80.\r\nFitting the default model with 50% of the data took less than 3 minutes using HPC!!\r\nFirst round of tuning\r\nRandom forest models are know to have very good out-of-the-box performance, however, I wanted to tune at least mtry and min_n to evaluate how much lower the rmse could be.\r\nI decided not to spend time tuning for number of trees as the literature suggests that growing p * 10 trees is pretty safe. The number of trees needs to be large enough to stabilize the error rate; for this model I could have used 770 trees, but I went for 1000 trees just to be extra safe.\r\nTo tune for mtry and min_n, I followed what Boehmke & Greenwell (2020) suggest in the chapter focused on random forest models in the book Hands-On Machine Learning with R\r\n“Start with five evenly spaced values of mtry across the range 2 – p centered at the recommended default” (Boehmke & Greenwell, 2020).\r\n“When adjusting node size start with three values between 1–10 and adjust depending on impact to accuracy and run time (Boehmke & Greenwell, 2020).”\r\nHere I created a regular grid with 20 different combinations of mtry and min_n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\"],[2,14,26,38,50,2,14,26,38,50,2,14,26,38,50,2,14,26,38,50],[1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,10,10,10,10,10]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>mtry<\\/th>\\n      <th>min_n<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[1,2]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\r\nBelow is a function that Daniel helped me build. This is an all-in-one function that builds the model, updates the default model workflow with the new hyperparameters, fits the models with the selected hyperparameters, and outputs a table with the tuned hyperparameters and the corresponding rmse value.

Whereas each round of tuning took around two hours, with very little return (imo). I guess that the person who said that random forest models have great out-of-the-box performance was not joking!\r\nFinal fit\r\nAt this point I was convinced that continue to tune was not worth the time, however, I had already spent quite a bit of time in model tuning so I decided to use mtry = 14 and a min_n = 15, the hyperparameters that produced the lowest rmse on my model tuning process.\r\n\r\n\r\n# final model with hard coded hyperparameters\r\nfinal_mod <- rand_forest() %>%\r\n  set_engine(\"ranger\",\r\n             num.threads = 8,\r\n             importance = \"permutation\",\r\n             verbose = TRUE) %>%\r\n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>%\r\n  set_args(mtry = 14,\r\n           min_n = 15,\r\n           trees = 1000)\r\n\r\n# workflow for final model\r\nfinal_wkfl <-  workflow() %>%\r\n  add_model(final_mod) %>%\r\n  add_recipe(rec)\r\n\r\n# final split on the initial split\r\nfinal_fit <- last_fit(final_wkfl,\r\n                      split = data_split)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFitting the final model took around 4 minutes and the resulting rmse was 88.3.\r\nKaggle submission\r\nThe next step was to submit predictions to Kaggle to test how the model performed when compared against the true values. To do this I had to fit the model using the unsplit dataset called data, read in the test.csv file, join the bonus data, prep and bake the recipe and create a dataframe with the predicted score values.\r\n\r\n\r\n# fit with the unsplit data\r\ncheck_fit <- final_wkfl %>%\r\n                 fit(data)\r\n\r\n# read in test.csv file\r\nfull_test <- import(\"data/test.csv\", setclass = \"tbl_df\") %>%\r\n  mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>%\r\n  mutate(ncessch = as.double(ncessch))\r\n\r\n## joining data\r\nall_test <- left_join(full_test, bonus)\r\n\r\n# baking the recipe\r\nprocessed_test <- rec %>%\r\n  prep() %>% \r\n  bake(all_test)\r\n\r\n# make predictions\r\npreds <- predict(check_fit, all_test)\r\n\r\n# a tibble\r\npred_frame <- tibble(Id = all_test$id, Predicted = preds$.pred)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis table shows only the first six rows of data:\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\"],[4,6,8,9,11,15],[2492.97321250139,2501.58582718069,2668.15853429978,2464.77458894793,2530.78887087146,2487.80269035691]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>Id<\\/th>\\n      <th>Predicted<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[1,2]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\r\n\r\nI was gladly surprised to find that the model performed better than expected! 🥳\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Lasso Regression (Type of penalized Regression)\r\n1.Splitting and resampling\r\nData splitting and resampling is a method to ensure that predictive performance of ML model is unbiased.\r\n1a. Splitting\r\nWe will split our dataset into training and testing set. The training data will be used to fit our model and tune its parameters, whereas the testing data will be used to evaluate our final model’s performance.\r\nWe will use initial_split() function from the rsample package which creates a split object. The split object d_split, tells how many observations we have in our training and testing set (trainin set = 75% & testing set = 25%).\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\n# Create split object specifying (75%) and testing (25%)\r\n\r\ndata_split <- initial_split(data, prop = 3/4) \r\n\r\ndata_split\r\n\r\n<Analysis/Assess/Total>\r\n<1421/473/1894>\r\n\r\nWe will extract the training and testing set from the split object, d_split by using the training() and testing() functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Extract training and testing set\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\n\r\ndata_train <- training(data_split)  # Our training dataset has 1421 observations.\r\n\r\ndata_test <- testing(data_split)    # Our test dataset has 473 observations.\r\n\r\n1b. Resampling\r\nAt some point, ML models require parameters tuning (adjustment). In order to prepare for tuning, we resample our data. Resampling reduces bias from over-fitting the data. There are several methods to resample the data and the two most effective and frequently used are 10-fold cross validation and bootstrapping. In our project, we’ll resample our data using vfold_cv(). This function outputs k-fold cross-validated versions of our training data, where k = number of time we resample.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Resample the data with 10-fold cross validation.\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\ncv <- vfold_cv(data_train)\r\n\r\n2.Pre-processing\r\nPreprocessing is a way of converting data from the raw form to a more usable form for the ML modeling purpose. The pre-processing involves defining roles of variables using role-specifying functions such as all_numeric(), all_predictors() as arguments to pre-processing steps. Pre-processing also involves steps such as imputation (step_medianimpute), rescaling (step_scale), standardizing (step_normalize), PCA (step_pca) and creating dummy variables (step_dummy). A full list of pre-processing can be found here.\r\nWe will use recipe() function to indicate our outcome and predictor variables in our recipe. We will use ~. to indicate that we are using all variables to predict the outcome variable score. All recipe takes from the data object at this point is the names and roles of the outcome and predictor variables. We will apply this recipe to specific dataset later. Therefore, when we print summary of object, rec, it shows numbers of predictor variables have been specified. It doen’t actually apply the predictors yet. We will use same receipe throughout this post.\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\n\r\nrec <- recipe(score ~ ., data_train) %>% \r\n  step_mutate(tst_dt = as.numeric(lubridate::\r\n                                    mdy_hms(tst_dt))) %>% # convert `test date` variable to a date \r\n  update_role(contains(\"id\"), ncessch, new_role = \"id vars\") %>% # declare ID variables\r\n  step_nzv(all_predictors(), freq_cut = 0, unique_cut = 0) %>% # remove variables with zero variances\r\n  step_novel(all_nominal()) %>% # prepares test data to handle previously unseen factor levels \r\n  step_unknown(all_nominal()) %>% # categorizes missing categorical data (NA's) as `unknown`\r\n  step_medianimpute(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes(), \r\n                    -has_role(\"id vars\"))  %>% # replaces missing numeric observations with the median\r\n  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -has_role(\"id vars\")) %>% # dummy codes categorical variables\r\n  step_nzv(all_predictors(), -starts_with(\"lang_cd\"))\r\n\r\nExtract the pre-processed dataset\r\nTo extract the pre-processed dataset, we can prep() the recipe for our datset then bake() the prepped recipe to extract the pre-processed data.\r\nHowever, in tidymodels we can use workflows() where we don’t need to prep() or bake() the recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nprep(rec) #%>%\r\n\r\nData Recipe\r\n\r\nInputs:\r\n\r\n      role #variables\r\n   id vars          8\r\n   outcome          1\r\n predictor         79\r\n\r\nTraining data contained 1421 data points and 1421 incomplete rows. \r\n\r\nOperations:\r\n\r\nVariable mutation for tst_dt [trained]\r\nSparse, unbalanced variable filter removed calc_admn_cd, lang_cd [trained]\r\nNovel factor level assignment for gndr, ethnic_cd, ...

To specify the model, there are four primary components: model type, arguments, engine, and mode.\r\n3. Linear model\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\n\r\n# Specify the model\r\n\r\nmod_linear <- linear_reg() %>%\r\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>%  # engine for linear regression\r\n  set_mode(\"regression\")  # regression for continous outcome varaible.\r\n\r\n# Workflow\r\nlm_wf <- workflow() %>% # set the workflow\r\n  add_recipe(rec) %>% # add recipe\r\n  add_model(mod_linear) # add model\r\n  \r\n\r\n# Fit the linear model\r\nmod_linear_fit<- fit_resamples(\r\n  mod_linear,\r\n  preprocessor = rec,\r\n  resamples = cv,\r\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse),\r\n  control = control_resamples(verbose = TRUE,\r\n                                    save_pred = TRUE))\r\n\r\nCollect metrics on linear model\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(3000)\r\n\r\nmod_linear_fit %>%\r\n  collect_metrics() %>%\r\n  filter(.metric == \"rmse\") \r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 5\r\n  .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err\r\n  <chr>   <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl>\r\n1 rmse    standard    96.3    10    2.49\r\n\r\n#RMSE = 96.28\r\n\r\nOur data has multiple variables and some of them are highly correlated. In case like this, linear model usually performs poorly. So let’s try other alternatives such as penalized regression. We will use the same recipe (i.e. rec) for all models in this post. We will use tune_grid() to perform a grid search for the best combination of tuned hyperparameters such penalty.\r\n4.

Joining the datasets\r\nFor the purpose of demonstration, we will be using 1% of the data with sample_frac() to keep computing time low. All our datasets have school ids which we used as key to join the datasets.\r\nAfter loading our three datasets, we joined them together to make one cohesive dataset, to be used for ML modeling. After joining, the dataset contains student-level variables (e.g. gender, ethnicity, enrollement in special education, etc.) as well as district-level variables ( school longitude and latitude, proportion of free and reduced lunch, etc.). All of these variables will be used in our ML models to predict student score in the statewide assessment.

Introduction\r\nFor this project, we collected and joined three structured datasets and one supplemental small dataset only for XG boost model. Datasets are selected on the basis of variables that were correlated with the outcome variable. In our datasets, our outcome variable is children’s score on the statewide assessment. Please see below for more information on each dataset.\r\n2. Statewide testing data (Original dataset)\r\nStudents in every state across the nation are tested annually in reading and math in grades 3-8. Dataset used in the project are simulated from an actual statewide testing administration across the state of Oregon and the overall distribution are highly similar. Our continous outcome variable is score which is also presented in categorical form as classification. For the project, our models are run to predict the continous score variable. Our data contains other variables of interest (predictors) such as gender, ethnicity, economic disadvange, and location. In our simulated dataset, school ids are real which we used as key to join other datasets. Here is the preview of our statewide testing dataset.\r\n\r\nTable 1: Data summary\r\nName\r\nd\r\nNumber of rows\r\n1894\r\nNumber of columns\r\n39\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nColumn type frequency:\r\n\r\ncharacter\r\n28\r\nlogical\r\n1\r\nnumeric\r\n10\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nGroup variables\r\n\r\nVariable type: character\r\nskim_variable\r\nn_missing\r\ncomplete_rate\r\nmin\r\nmax\r\nempty\r\nn_unique\r\nwhitespace\r\ngndr\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nethnic_cd\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n7\r\n0\r\ntst_bnch\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n2\r\n2\r\n0\r\n6\r\n0\r\ntst_dt\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n16\r\n17\r\n0\r\n48\r\n0\r\nmigrant_ed_fg\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nind_ed_fg\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nsp_ed_fg\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ntag_ed_fg\r\n3\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\necon_dsvntg\r\n4\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nayp_lep\r\n1540\r\n0.19\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n8\r\n0\r\nstay_in_dist\r\n3\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nstay_in_schl\r\n3\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ndist_sped\r\n3\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ntrgt_assist_fg\r\n3\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nayp_dist_partic\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nayp_schl_partic\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nayp_dist_prfrm\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nayp_schl_prfrm\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nrc_dist_partic\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nrc_schl_partic\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nrc_dist_prfrm\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nrc_schl_prfrm\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nlang_cd\r\n1851\r\n0.02\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n1\r\n0\r\ntst_atmpt_fg\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ngrp_rpt_dist_partic\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ngrp_rpt_schl_partic\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ngrp_rpt_dist_prfrm\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\ngrp_rpt_schl_prfrm\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n0\r\nVariable type: logical\r\nskim_variable\r\nn_missing\r\ncomplete_rate\r\nmean\r\ncount\r\ncalc_admn_cd\r\n1894\r\n0\r\nNaN\r\n:\r\nVariable type: numeric\r\nskim_variable\r\nn_missing\r\ncomplete_rate\r\nmean\r\nsd\r\nhist\r\nid\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1.267936e+05\r\n72111.86\r\n▇▇▇▇▇\r\nattnd_dist_inst_id\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n2.116080e+03\r\n188.53\r\n▇▁▁▁▁\r\nattnd_schl_inst_id\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n1.345800e+03\r\n1388.28\r\n▇▃▁▁▁\r\nenrl_grd\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n5.440000e+00\r\n1.67\r\n▇▅▃▃▃\r\npartic_dist_inst_id\r\n4\r\n1.00\r\n2.116160e+03\r\n188.71\r\n▇▁▁▁▁\r\npartic_schl_inst_id\r\n4\r\n1.00\r\n1.345210e+03\r\n1386.64\r\n▇▃▁▁▁\r\nscore\r\n0\r\n1.00\r\n2.498910e+03\r\n113.99\r\n▁▂▇▅▁\r\nncessch\r\n29\r\n0.98\r\n4.106795e+11\r\n385634091.96\r\n▆▅▅▇▃\r\nlat\r\n31\r\n0.98\r\n4.476000e+01\r\n1.00\r\n▂▁▃▅▇\r\nlon\r\n31\r\n0.98\r\n-1.224600e+02\r\n1.28\r\n▆▇▁▁▁\r\n\r\n3.
